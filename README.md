## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- Vite

### What I learned

- This is my first time using TypeScript on my own, and I find that it's much more confusing than when I follow the tutorials.
- This challenge introduces me to web audio API.
- I learn how to make an API request in React. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxUzZzGrEkA) - This video explains the big picture of web audio API.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTBta08fXGU&list=LL&index=5) - Handling Fetch Errors in React. This person is a really good teacher, I think I will check out the entire React playlist later.
